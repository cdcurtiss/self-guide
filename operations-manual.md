## 1. Incident Escalation Protocol

Volunteers must adhere to the chain of command to prevent radio congestion. Do not bypass your direct supervisor unless it is a medical emergency.

### Chain of Command

1. **Level 1:** Volunteer (Crowd/Stage Hand)
2. **Level 2:** Stage Manager (Venue Lead)
3. **Level 3:** Domain Director (Music/Lit)
4. **Level 4:** Executive Director (Festival Lead)

### Procedure: Reporting a Schedule Delay

If an artist has not arrived by **T-Minus 15 minutes**:

1. **Volunteer:** Locate the Stage Manager visually. Do not use the radio.
2. **Stage Manager:** Hail the **Domain Director** on Channel 2.
   - *Script:* "Music Director, this is [Venue Name]. Artist is not on site at T-Minus 15."
3. **Domain Director:** Determine if the set must be cut short or shifted.

---

## 2. Stage Changeover Protocol

**Role:** Stage Managers & Tech Volunteers  
**Goal:** Transition between acts within the 15-minute buffer.

**Steps:**

1. **Clear the Deck (T-Minus 15):** Stage Manager gives the "Clear" signal. Volunteers escort the previous artist off stage-left.
2. **Line Check (T-Minus 10):** Audio Engineer unmutes monitors. Next artist plugs in. **Note:** No full songs. Line check only.
3. **Safety Check (T-Minus 5):** Volunteers tape down all loose cabling (Gaffer tape only). Stage Manager confirms fire exits are unblocked.
4. **Go Flight:** Stage Manager cues House Lights Down.

---

---

## 6. Multi-Stage Festival Coordination Issues

### 6.1 Schedule Domino Effect (Cascading Delays)

**Role:** Domain Director & Executive Director

**Trigger:** One delay threatens to impact 2+ subsequent performances

**Procedure:**

1. **Stage Manager (Origin Venue):**
   - Radio Channel 2: *"[Venue Name] to [Domain] Director. Running [X] minutes behind. Advising potential cascade effect."*

2. **Domain Director (Immediate Assessment):**
   - Pull current master schedule
   - Identify all affected performances in next 2-hour window
   - Calculate if delays can be absorbed or require intervention

3. **Decision Matrix:**

   **Delay < 10 minutes:**
   - Compress changeover times (reduce from 15 min to 10 min)
   - Alert subsequent Stage Managers to prepare for early call

   **Delay 10-20 minutes:**
   - Domain Director convenes quick radio conference (Channel 2)
   - Options:
     - Cut one intermission act to absorb time
     - Shift one performance to alternate stage (if available)
     - Reduce set length for non-headliner act (requires artist consent)

   **Delay > 20 minutes:**

### 6.2 Artist at Wrong Venue

**Role:** All Staff (Time-Critical Response)

**Scenario:** Artist arrives at Venue A when scheduled for Venue B

**Procedure:**

1. **Volunteer/Stage Manager (Discovery):**
   - Verify artist identity and scheduled venue
   - Radio Channel 2 (immediately): *"[Your Venue] to [Domain] Director. Artist [Name] on-site but scheduled for [Correct Venue]."*

2. **Domain Director:**
   - Check current time vs. scheduled start
   - Determine if artist can reach correct venue in time

3. **Action Plan:**

   **If > 20 minutes until start time:**
   - Assign volunteer escort to transport artist to correct venue
   - Alert correct venue's Stage Manager: *"Artist en route, ETA [X] minutes."*
   - Provide artist with golf cart/vehicle if available

   **If 10-20 minutes until start:**

### 6.3 Equipment Conflict Between Stages

**Role:** Domain Director & Stage Managers

**Trigger:** Two stages need same shared resource simultaneously

**Common Conflicts:**
- Shared microphones, DI boxes, cables
- Mobile lighting rig
- Generator/power distribution
- Golf carts for artist transport

**Prevention Protocol:**

1. **During Event Planning:**
   - Domain Director creates **Equipment Allocation Schedule**
   - High-priority events get guaranteed equipment
   - Lower-priority events have backup plans

2. **When Conflict Occurs:**
   
   **Stage Manager A (Needs Equipment):**
   - Radio Channel 3 (Tech): *"[Venue A] requesting [Equipment]. Currently scheduled for [Venue B]."*

   **Tech Coordinator:**
   - Checks allocation schedule
   - Determines priority (headliner > opener > filler)
   - Responds: *"Equipment stays at [Priority Venue]. [Other Venue] use backup [X]."*

3. **If No Backup Available:**
   - Tech Coordinator escalates to Domain Director
   - Domain Director options:
     - **Delay lower-priority set** until equipment available
     - **Source replacement** from vendor/rental company
     - **Modify performance** (acoustic set, reduced production)

4. **Emergency Equipment Matrix:**
   - All Stage Managers keep list of **Minimum Viable Equipment** (what act absolutely needs vs. nice-to-have)
   - Example: Acoustic act needs 2 mics minimum; can perform without monitors if necessary

**Script for Artist:**
> *"We're experiencing an equipment conflict. We can provide [available gear] or delay your set 15 minutes for full setup. Your preference?"*

---

### 6.4 Audience Overflow / Unsafe Crowd Migration

**Role:** Stage Manager, Security, Executive Director

**Trigger:** One performance ends, crowd migrates en masse to another venue

**Procedure:**

1. **Stage Manager (Receiving Venue):**
   - Monitor crowd density as previous event ends
   - Radio Channel 4 (Security) when venue reaches 75% capacity: *"[Venue Name] at 75%. Requesting crowd control."*

2. **Security Team:**
   - Deploys to choke points (entrances, narrow pathways)
   - Implements **Metered Entry**: Allow people in only as others exit
   - Radio when venue reaches safe capacity: *"[Venue Name] at capacity. Holding further entry."*

3. **Stage Manager:**
   - Radio Channel 1 (Executive Director): *"[Venue Name] at capacity. Crowd control in effect."*
   - Posts volunteer at entrance with sign: "At Capacity – Please Enjoy [Alternate Venue]"

4. **Executive Director Decision:**
   - **Option A:** Maintain hard cap (fire code compliance)
   - **Option B:** Open overflow viewing area (if available and safe)
   - **Option C:** Simulcast audio to external speakers (crowd watches from adjacent area)

5. **Communication to Crowd:**
   - Volunteer at entrance: *"This venue is at safe capacity for everyone's safety. You can enjoy [Artist Name] from the lawn area with full audio, or check out [Alternate Performance] at [Other Venue]."*

**Prevention Strategy:**
- Schedule smaller acts opposite headliners when possible
- Create "flow map" during planning to predict crowd movements
- Position food/beverage vendors to naturally distribute crowds

---

## 7. Access & Accommodation Issues

2. **Stage Manager or Venue Lead:**
   - Deploys volunteer to:
     - Direct individuals needing accommodation to alternate accessible route, OR
     - Provide personal assistance (with permission) to navigate temporarily, OR
     - Relocate to equivalent accessible seating/viewing area

3. **Executive Director:**
   - Ensures repair/resolution within 15 minutes
   - If not fixable: Implements alternate accommodation plan
   - Logs incident for legal compliance documentation

**Script to Individual:**
> *"I apologize for this access issue. Let me personally escort you to [alternate route/area], or I can bring [staff member] to assist. We're fixing this immediately."*

#### Scenario B: ASL Interpreter No-Show

**Trigger:** Scheduled interpreter doesn't arrive by T-Minus 15

**Procedure:**

1. **Stage Manager:**

**Procedure:**

1. **Volunteer/Security (First Contact):**
   - Politely stop individual: *"I need to verify your media credentials. One moment please."*
   - Radio Stage Manager: *"Media credential issue at [location]."*

2. **Stage Manager:**
   - Checks media list (provided during planning)
   - If **credentialed:** Escort to appropriate area, provide media wristband
   - If **not on list:** Radio Domain Director for approval

3. **Domain Director Decision Matrix:**
   
   **Legitimate media, administrative error:**
   - Verify identity (press badge, recent published work)
   - Grant provisional access, document post-event

   **Legitimate media, but not pre-approved:**
   - Explain: *"We'd love to accommodate you, but this event requires pre-approval due to artist/venue requirements. I can provide contact info for future events."*
   - Offer general admission ticket if available

   **Suspicious/unauthorized:**
   - Politely deny: *"This event is closed to non-credentialed media. You're welcome to attend as a guest if tickets are available."*
   - If person persists: Security escorts from property

4. **Special Case – Artist Objects to Media Presence:**
   - Artist has final say on their own coverage
   - Stage Manager immediately removes media from photo pit/backstage
   - Domain Director notifies media of restriction
   - Offer alternate coverage opportunity (different artist, different time)

**Documentation:**
- All media access grants/denials logged
- Executive Director reviews for future planning

---

## 8. Technology & Systems Failures

**Immediate Response:**

1. **Box Office Lead (Discovery):**
   - Radio Channel 1: *"Internet down. Ticketing systems offline. Requesting backup protocol."*
   - Posts volunteer at all entry points

2. **Executive Director (Immediate Authorization):**
   - Implements **Manual Entry Protocol** (if internet down < 30 minutes):
```
     - Accept printed/mobile tickets, mark with Sharpie to prevent re-entry
     - Check photo ID against name on ticket (honor system)
     - Maintain manual tally of entries per venue (capacity tracking)
     - Hand-write wristband numbers in log
```
   
   - Implements **Cash-Only Protocol** (for concessions/merch):
```
     - Post signs: "Cash Only – ATM located at [location]"
     - Use manual credit card imprinters if available (old-school slider)
     - Record all transactions in paper log for reconciliation
```

3. **If Internet Down > 30 minutes:**
   - Executive Director contacts IT support/ISP
   - Considers mobile hotspot as temporary bridge
   - May implement **Emergency Free Entry** if ticketing cannot be verified:
```
     - Announce: "Due to technical issues, we're honoring all ticket holders. 
       Please retain your ticket for verification if needed."
     - Accept good-faith honor system
     - Maintain capacity counts manually
```

4. **Recovery:**
   - When internet restored, Box Office Lead:
     - Reconciles manual logs with digital system
     - Processes delayed credit card transactions (if signed receipts obtained)
     - Reports discrepancies to Executive Director

   - When venue reaches **90% of fire code capacity:**
     - Radio Channel 1: *"[Venue] at 90% capacity. Implementing soft cap."*
     - Begins metered entry (1-in, 1-out)

2. **At 100% Capacity:**
   - Radio Channel 1: *"[Venue] at FULL capacity. Hard stop on entry."*
   - Security posts at all entrances
   - Volunteers hold signs: "At Safe Capacity – Alternate Viewing at [Location]"

3. **If Crowd Continues to Push/Enter:**
   - Stage Manager radios Executive Director: *"Unable to maintain capacity cap at [Venue]. Advise."*

4. **Executive Director Options:**
