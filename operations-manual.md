# Event Operations Manual & Run of Show

**Effective Date:** September 23, 202X  
**Scope:** All Stages & Venues

## 1. Incident Escalation Protocol

Volunteers must adhere to the chain of command to prevent radio congestion. Do not bypass your direct supervisor unless it is a medical emergency.

### Chain of Command

2.  **Level 2:** Stage Manager (Venue Lead)
3.  **Level 3:** Domain Director (Music/Lit)
4.  **Level 4:** Executive Director (Festival Lead)

### Procedure: Reporting a Schedule Delay
If an artist has not arrived by **T-Minus 15 minutes**:

1.  **Volunteer:** Locate the Stage Manager visually. Do not use the radio.
2.  **Stage Manager:** Hail the **Domain Director** on Channel 2.
    * *Script:* "Music Director, this is [Venue Name]. Artist is not on site at T-Minus 15."
3.  **Domain Director:** Determine if the set must be cut short or shifted.

## 2. Stage Changeover Protocol

**Role:** Stage Managers & Tech Volunteers  
**Goal:** Transition between acts within the 15-minute buffer.

**Steps:**

2.  **Line Check (T-Minus 10):** Audio Engineer unmutes monitors. Next artist plugs in. **Note:** No full songs. Line check only.
3.  **Safety Check (T-Minus 5):** Volunteers tape down all loose cabling (Gaffer tape only). Stage Manager confirms fire exits are unblocked.
4.  **Go Flight:** Stage Manager cues House Lights Down.
