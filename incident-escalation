## 1. Incident Escalation Protocol

Volunteers must adhere to the chain of command to prevent radio congestion. Do not bypass your direct supervisor unless it is a medical emergency.

### Chain of Command
1.  **Level 1:** Volunteer (Crowd/Stage Hand)
2.  **Level 2:** Stage Manager (Venue Lead)
3.  **Level 3:** Domain Director (Music/Lit)
4.  **Level 4:** Executive Director (Festival Lead)

### Procedure: Reporting a Schedule Delay
If an artist has not arrived by **T-Minus 15 minutes**:

1.  **Volunteer:** Locate the Stage Manager visually. Do not use the radio.
2.  **Stage Manager:** Hail the **Domain Director** on Channel 2.
    * *Script:* "Music Director, this is [Venue Name]. Artist is not on site at T-Minus 15."
3.  **Domain Director:**
    * Determine if the set must be cut short or shifted.
    * If the delay impacts other venues, contact the **Executive Director**.
